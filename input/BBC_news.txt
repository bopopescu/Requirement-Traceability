The Premier League, English Football League and Football Association have been accused of "double standards" for not holding tributes for 50 people killed in New Zealand's mosque attacks.
Six Nations and rugby league games held silences this weekend but English top flight and FA Cup games did not.
Premier League clubs wore black bands and France's national anthem was played after November 2015's Paris attacks.
Yunus Lunat, former FA race equality board chair, called it "hypocrisy".
When tributes were held in 2015, Premier League chief Richard Scudamore said it was an act of "solidarity and remembrance" following the attacks in the French capital, in which 130 people died.
Lunat told BBC Sport: "There is no excuse, whenever something has happened, not even on the same scale, football has always come out and paid tribute.
"It is double standards and hypocrisy. To hold a minute's silence was the right thing to do. When it happens for the events, it has to happen across the board for every attack."
The fatal shooting at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday killed 50 people and left a further 48 wounded.
